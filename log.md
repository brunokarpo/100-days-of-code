##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 1: Octuber 19, 2023

**Today's Progress**: Created the structure of project Review Worker and implemented the test and code of the main business rule of service.

**Thoughts:** Basicamente criei um código simples que estou acostumado a criar, simplemente para começar a prática de codificar todos os dias. Espero que, à medida que eu for codificando mais e mais, e através de estudos paralelos, meu código melhore ao longo do tempo. O objetivo é, ao longo do processo de aprendizagem, conseguir verificar minhas evoluções.
